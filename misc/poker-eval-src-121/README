Introduction
============

This is the README file for the pokersource poker hand evaluator
library.  The library may be obtained from the pokersource web site,
www.pokersource.org.  

To learn more about the features of the library, and how to get
started using it, see the WHATS-HERE file in the root directory of the
library distribution.  

The PokerSource evaluator library is free software and is released
under the terms of the GNU General Public License.  See the LICENSE file
in the root directory of the distribution.

The PokerSource library includes an optional Java layer.  You can compile the
C library on its own, or you can compile both the C library and the Java
layer.  In order to compile the Java layer, you will need the following
packages.  Jar files are provided as part of the distribution for your
convenience; you can also download the sources or jar files yourself.
    Apache Oro regular expressions (org.apache.oro.*) [tested with v2.0.6]
        http://jakarta.apache.org/oro/
        See the file LICENSE.oro for license details.  
        This product includes software developed by the
        Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).
    JUnit test framework (junit.framework.*) [tested with v3.7]
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/junit/
        See the file LICENSE.junit for license details.
The Java code is documented in the java/javadoc directory.


Compiling -- Unix systems
=========================
This library uses the GNU Autoconf self-configuration mechanism, so
compiling on a Unix system should be fairly simple.  If you want to
build both the C library and the java layer, say
  ./configure
  make 
  make test
Or, if you do not want to build the java layer, say
  ./configure --disable-java
  make
  make test

The "make test" command will run several test programs to ensure that
everything works correctly.  On slow machines, the tests may take
several minutes.  (Note: The make files may have some dependencies on GNU
make; if you do not have GNU make, they may need to be edited before the
library and test programs will compile properly.)

After you have a working build, you may want to:
* add the examples directory to your PATH environment variable
* add the lib directory to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
* add java/pokersource.jar to your CLASSPATH environment variable
* add java/jakarta-oro-2.0.6.jar to your CLASSPATH environment variable
* add java/junit-3.7.jar to your CLASSPATH environment variable


Compiling -- Windows, using cygwin 
==================================
If you have the cygwin package installed, you can build the library as
per the directions above for Unix systems.  (You may need to create a
link for /bin (some versions of cygwin don't do this properly on
installation) so that the configure script can find /bin/sh and other
required files.)  


Compiling -- DOS / Windows
==========================
The C portion of the library can also be compiled using Microsoft Visual
C++.  In each directory, special DOS makefiles are provided, called
makefile.dos.  To compile the library, make sure that the VC tools are
on the path and that the LIB variable is properly set (VC provides a
batch file, vcvars32.bat, to set this up), and enter the following
commands:
  cd lib
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\examples
  nmake -f makefile.dos
  cd ..\tests
  nmake -f makefile.dos

The Java layer is not supported yet.

You can't use make to run the test programs under Windows as you can
on Unix, but you can run them (digtest5 and digtest7, in the tests
directory) and compare the output value with the value in the make
file (makefile.dos in the tests directory) to ensure that the right
thing happened.  

Once the library is built, you can use the resulting library
(libpoker.lib) in other Visual C++ projects.  Make sure to put the
include directory of the pokersource library package in the include
path for projects that will be using the library.  



Reporting bugs, suggesting improvements
=======================================
As of August 1999, the pokersource evaluator library is maintained by
Brian Goetz.  Bug reports, suggestions for improvements, or candidates
for inclusion should be sent to brian@quiotix.com.
